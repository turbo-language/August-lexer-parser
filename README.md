# Rust translation of the Lexer

## Currently Completed:
- Handles comments effectively
- alpha-numeric tokens
- Updated token library with more tokens
- General Lexing complete
- Tokens Vector is now a vector of tuples: `Vec<(token_name, token_type)>`

## To be completed:
- Handling non-alpha-numeric tokens/Boilerplate tokens.

# Rust translation of the Parser
- To Be Completed Soon:
    - Algorithm
    - Implementation
    - Additional research
